<h1>My Job Experience</h1>
<p>I have always been a believer that we all have a purpose which we have been given the time to try to find it, and then find ways how we could improve in that area. Hence, I have always been careful towards how I spent my time. In addition to that, following the global pandemic, and after spending majority of my time in lockdown, I was really looking for ways to be able to manage my time in the best way possible, and wanted to be as productive as I could be.</p>
<p>I am open to gain new experiences, specially the ones that push me out my comfort zone. Moreover, I strongly believe that knowing more regarding how the businesses works, is an essential. Due to my knowledge in the English language, I was able to start working in Golzar Ettesal trading company as the commercial expert. This opportunity allowed me to gain hands-on information in this field of work.</p>
<p>This work experience aided me to become more disciplined, improved my skills on how to deal and solve problems better, and assisted me to grow and become a young woman who believes more confidently in her potentials.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I am so grateful to meet tons of people from different backgrounds as my colleagues. It is such an amazing journey to follow the same goal with other people, which made me more interested in doing team works as well.</p>
<p>Another important lesson I obtained from this prospect, was that for the first time in my life, I had an income. Which in addition to the freedom and independence it gave me, it came with a lot of responsibility such as money management, which is a  very important skill that young people like me should be able to handle.</p>
