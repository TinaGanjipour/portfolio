<p>While taking Microprocessor courses, I became fascinated by how an Arduino board functions. Hence, I decided to explore more on this field. <br>Currently, I am working on a project with this platform, which the main goal is to analyze Biofeedback using Arduino board.</p>
<br>
  <h1>Analyzing Biofeedback</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Biosignals are measured nowadays for various reasons. In many cases, biosignals such
    as the ECG (electrocardiogram) or pulse rate, skin temperature or breathing frequency and
    many other parameters are measured for medical reasons. Other possible applications
    are met in many sports disciplines, or even in human-machine interfaces (HMIs),
    e.g., to control a prosthesis, an exoskeleton, or a robot.</p>
  <p>As glued electrodes for ECG measurements and rigid systems for other measurements
    are uncomfortable in long-term usage, many approaches to integrate electrodes into clothes
    or to prepare textile-based electrodes have been reported during the last decades.</p>
  <p>Nowadays, a broad variety of single circuit boards is available for this purpose, i.e., microcontrollers or microcomputers, which are often small enough to be integrated in clothes
    without strongly irritating the wearer if the smaller boards are chosen, or those which are
    specially designed for textile-integration, such as LilyPad Arduino boards.</p>
  <h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>A biofeedback system is a type of device that measures physiological signals from the body, such as heart rate, respiration rate, skin conductance, and muscle tension.
  <br>The device then provides real-time feedback to the user in the form of visual or auditory signals, which can help the user to learn how to control their own physiological responses.</p>
<p>In this project, the main purpose is making a digital device that visualizes analog signal.<br>
  To build a biofeedback system using an Arduino board, I will be connecting the board to physiological sensors that can measure the relevant physiological signals.
  I will be using an electrocardiogram (ECG) sensor to measure the user's heart rate</p>
<p>Once the sensors are connected to the Arduino board, I will write the code via Arduni IDE platform in C language, to process the data from the sensors and provide feedback to the user.
  I will be using a simple LED display to provide visual feedback, with different colors indicating different physiological states.</p>
<p>Overall, a biofeedback system using an Arduino board can be a powerful tool for helping users to learn how to control their own physiological responses, which can be useful for managing stress, anxiety, and other health conditions.</p>
